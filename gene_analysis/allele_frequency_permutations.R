# File initially created on April 19, 2021

# The code in this file will test the pairwise differences between the allele
# frequencies of deletions and insertions overlapping various genic features
# using a permutation approach.

# The "overlap" column of the data object will be randomly shuffled 10,000
# times and the mean for each group computed each time. The comparison of the
# observed differences in allele frequency and the random distrbution of those
# differences will allow a p-value to be attributed to each of the 12 pairwise
# differences between groups (6 for deletions, and 6 for insertions). A correction
# will be applied to compensate for multiple testing.
