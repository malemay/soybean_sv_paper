# Benchmarking the structural variants called by Illumina from the variants discovered by Oxford Nanopore
#  on the fourth version of the soybean reference genome assembly with sveval. 

# The difference with the code in benchmark.R is that here we will use an input bed file
# to restrict our analysis to non-repeated regions

# Loading the required libraries
library(rtracklayer)
library(sveval) # (modified by me to allow for argument output.all)
