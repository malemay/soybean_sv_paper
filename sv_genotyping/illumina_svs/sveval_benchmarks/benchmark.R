# Benchmarking the structural variants called by Illumina from the variants discovered by Illumina
#  on the fourth version of the soybean reference genome assembly with sveval. 

# The variants against which the calls are benchmarked here have had their breakpoints refined using AGE

# Structural variants will be filtered post-reading with read_sv_filter (a wrapper around readSVvcf)
#  for the following criteria :
#  - Removal of variants that are not insertions, deletions, duplications or inversions (should have been removed already)
#  - Optional removal of heterozygous, missing, and homozygous reference genotype calls
#  - Removal of variants located on unmapped scaffolds or organellar genomes (should all have been removed already)
#  - Removal of insertion alternate alleles containing N nucleotides or unknown sequence (<INS>)
#  - Removal of insertion reference alleles with > 1 N nucleotide (to accomodate for Sniffles'
#     default "N" reference allele for insertions); should have been removed already
#  - Removal of deletions whose sequence contains any N (the threshold could be tuned)

# Only the benchmark with geno.eval = FALSE is done because heterozygous variants
# were not used for genotyping with Illumina

# Loading the sveval library (modified by me to allow for argument output.all)
