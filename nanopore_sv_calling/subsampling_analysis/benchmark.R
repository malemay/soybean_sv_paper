# Benchmarking the variants found by each of the Sniffles discovery steps based on
# subsampled .bam files using the sveval package.

# Four samples with average sequencing depth > 16 were chosen for this analysis:
# AC2001, ALTA, MAPLE_ISLE, and OAC_LAKEVIEW

# Each sample was subsampled at a fraction of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 of the original
# coverage 5 times using different seeds for each sampling

# Loading the sveval library (modified by me to allow for argument output.all)
